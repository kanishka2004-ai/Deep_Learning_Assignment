## üìÇ Contents

This repository includes the following assignments:

1. **Logistic Regression**
   - Implementation of binary classification using logistic regression.
   - Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

2. **Gradient Descent**
   - Demonstrates various gradient descent techniques (Batch, Stochastic, Mini-batch).
   - Visualizations included to show convergence.

3. **Loss and Cost Functions**
   - Exploration of different loss and cost functions used in machine learning.
   - Comparison and use-cases explained with examples.

4. **Regularization (L1 and L2)**
   - Implementations of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization.
   - Shows how regularization helps in avoiding overfitting.

5. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
   - Basic CNN model built for image classification tasks.
   - Layers include convolution, pooling, and dense layers.
